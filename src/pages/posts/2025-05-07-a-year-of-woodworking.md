## A Year of Woodworking

Life has been busy, but there's still been some woodworking. In fact, I've been pleasantly surprised by the number of pictures I found when making this post.

## Projects

### Woodworking Classes

I'm quite fortunate to live relatively close to Woodcraft of Atlanta, and took a number of fantasticclasses there from Robert Stebbins and Diana Spencer. While the resulting projects
were fantastic, the real challenge was learning how to do it again outside of a classroom setting.

The first image actually shows my original, pre-class asa-no-ha pattern at the top, and the much improved version at the bottom after the classes.

### Holiday Presents

A few holiday presents. The bottle toppers were my first foray into turning.

### Kenney-sian Boxes

I got pretty into [Matt Kenney's Work](https://www.mekwoodworks.com/52-boxes.html), and tried to emulate his style quite a bit. I'd love to try and tackle a few more of his designs in the future.

### Kumiko Box - Attempt 1

This was my first attempt at creating a Kumiko Box, done after a few of the basic kumiko classes. Honestly this one still isn't done, and just needs to have the kumiko sanded
a bit and some finish added.

### Kumiko Box - The Class Version

This was a class to build a box off the same [Michael Pekovich](https://www.pekovichwoodworks.com/hello) pattern as the one above. I was incredibly happy with how this box turned out, especially how tight the mitered corners were. However we had access to quite a few high end tools in that class that really helped push it to perfection.

### Kumiko Box - Attempt 2

This was done after the learnings of the class. No training wheels. No special tools. No magic Festool table saw that I still dream about sometimes.

The Kumiko grid on this box is the only one here that was _entirely cut by hand_ rather than the specialized table saw jig in the class. All in all I'm extremely happy with how this turned out, but also feel like I'm ready to move and try some other Kumiko projects.

## Final Thoughts

The one project I did not show here was a workbench I've been working on since October 2024. It has very, very slowly been coming along, but still needs quite a bit more work. With any luck, that will be included in the two year update.
