## Phenomenon of Life

- Seagram Building
- Stanley Drinking Cup

All aiming at the same **gestalt**, the same **feeling**.

- Which touches your soul most deeply?
- Which makes you experience life most deeply?
- Which expands your humanity more?
- Which would you rather be reincarnated as?
- Which is closer to God?
- Which would you caption with your own name?
- Which is more like a being?
- Which “glows” more?
- Which is more timeless – which would you not get sick of year after year?
- Which has more staying power?
- Which makes you feel more free?
