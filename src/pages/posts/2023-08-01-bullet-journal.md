# My Bullet Journal

For the past few years now I've kept a small Bullet Journal, and enjoy how it helps me structure
my work. At its core a Bullet Journal is a pretty simple todo list. You'll find places like [bulletjournal.com](bulletjournal.com) that manage to complicate it quite a bit. There you'll find ways to spend
money on courses, books, memberships, and blank journals, none of which I'd personally recommend.
There's really little need for any ceremony around it, but rather it's about figuring out what works best
for yourself in promoting mindfulness and intentionality day to day.

# Year's List of Goals

The first section in my journal is a list of goals for each year. Actually, I keep two lists for each year:

- The media I want to consume, be it movies, shows, or games.
- Personal projects I want to finish, or skills I want to learn.

I add and remove items from these lists as the year goes on, but it helps to see it all side by side.
With only so many days in a year I often realize there just isn't enough time for everything, and I
need to choose what's truly important to me.

It's also difficult for me to stay focused on a small number of tasks. Limiting myself to one item on
each list helps to keep the amount of work I have in flight low. My monkey mind also gets a little
endorphin rush whenever I actually complete one of the items, adding a date of completion next to it.

This list of goals becomes the guiding factor for the daily logs.

# Daily Log

Each daily section is rather short. It consists of

- The day's date.
- A few habits I try to do daily, each represented by a letter to be crossed out.
- A combined list of any important events, and what I want to do towards my goals.

I've changed the habits quite a bit over the years, trying to really keep a minimal list.
Though I didn't intend it, I've noticed they really all ended up revolving around my mental
and physical health.

- Medication - Easiest one to knock out, just have to remember to take my daily medication.
- Exercise - Doesn't get crossed out as often as I'd like, but it still keeps it front of mind.
- Meditation - Ideally 20 minutes of seated meditation.
- Cleaning - Try to spend 30 minutes a day just decluttering my home and main work areas.

Those items are the same each day. The Bullet Journal helps to act as a kind of habit backbone here as well. If I can keep up the habit of the Bullet Journal, I tend to do better on these four as well.

* Dinner and Boardgames with the neighbors.
- Watch an episode of True Detective.
- Get a draft of a new post for the blog.

# Finding What Works for You

The patterns around my Bullet Journal are relatively stable at this point, but it took a while to
really figure out what worked for me:

- A physical journal was crucial. I give up quite a bit in terms of search, metrics, and backups by not having
  things digital. But at the end of the day a physical book makes the practice more meaningful to me.
- Ignore some of the common tips around monthly/weekly logs. I'm sure some people find these helpful,
  for me it crossed into unhelpful overhead.
- Integrate the journal into your routine. Even more so, make it **_ritual._** I find sitting down with my morning
  coffee, without any other distractions helps get me in the right head space each day.
- Keep work out of it. I've got similar systems to track my work life, but I keep them strictly separate.
