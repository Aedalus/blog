  Brief thoughts on the difference, and how it pertains to the world of software.

I recently came across a short excerpt from **Anand Coomaraswamy's** **_ART AND SWADESHI_** that I found rather powerful. In it he makes a distinction between two kinds of instruments we use in our day to day work: tools and machines.

> The craftsman himself can always, if allowed to, draw the delicate distinction between the machine and the tool. The carpet loom is a tool, a contrivance for holding warp threads at a stretch, for the pile to be woven round them by the craftsmenâ€™s fingers; but the power loom is a machine, and its significance as a destroyer of culture lies in the fact that it does the essentially human part of the work and imposes limitations on the spontaneity and freedom of the design and the imagination of the worker.

### Tools vs Machines

What I find most fascinating about the above passage is how it ties our _tools themselves_ so directly to the kind of work that we can do. A good tool enhances our ability, our freedoms, our ability to rise in our own craft. A machine separates us from the world, reducing our connection to the work. My _microwave_ made my dinner, _I_ did not. But when I make the same dish from scratch, using the _tools_ of perhaps a stovetop, cutting boards, knives, etc, it was I who made the dish.

I don't believe this is simply a splitting of hairs, or a trick of linguistics. It goes back to the original passage:

> The craftsman himself can always, if allowed to, draw the delicate distinction between the machine and the tool.

This is not a distinction of the mind, with us closely evaluating the microwave, the stovetop, and comparing them to a predefined list of criteria. This is a distinction that arises directly from our _feeling_. When we think about it, this distinction can _only_ arise from deep feeling, as it is our capacity to feel that is uplifted or stifled by tools and machines.

### Applications in Software

I attempt to maintain a bullet journal every day, writing a couple lines about what I intend to get done, and keeping notes on some of my day to day tasks. There are countless apps out there that are created specifically for bullet journaling, but I find myself returning time and time again to a simple moleskine notebook I've kept for two years now. Unlike any of the apps, the notebook is an absolute mess of pen scribbles, and pen scribbles correcting those pen scribbles. Even the format for each day is somewhat inconsistent. Unlike any of the apps I can't search it easily, I can't pull metrics easily, and I'm one spilled cup of coffee away from losing it entirely.

Even though my notebook is inferior to the bullet journal applications by most normal criteria, I still find more valuable. Not only do I find myself more regularly returning to it and using it, but at a fundamental level I understand it as a tool for mindfullness that I myself cannot replicate digitally. Using a physical medium I'm more mindful and centered than I can be using an app. The individual pages have a tidyness or mess depending on my own state of mind that week. It's often the messy pages I find most endearing.

In this sense I've found myself becoming more particular about the kinds of software I use these days. There's plenty of software out there, especially tools like Blender and Photoshop, that fundamentally extends our capabilities as craftsmen. Much of this software has a steeper learning curve just like traditional tools, though that's unlikely a requirement and more just a characteristic of the freedom they provide.
